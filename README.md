**About**

This tutorial is about taking an existing package, re-building it, applying changes to it, and preparing those changes so that you can send them to a bug as a patch. This tutorial is now available as a video from Debian's Peertube instance in [English](https://peertube.debian.social/w/ceb19fea-a2ad-4e19-b783-19c6fd7d40da).
